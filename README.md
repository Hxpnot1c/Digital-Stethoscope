## Summary


 
## Build Guide

Print all 3D models, the specifc material is listed in file name.
All models should be 100% infill
(Our models were printed using Creality CR10 Smart Pro)
Most FDM 3D printers will be sufficient
Default setting on Cura slicer (with 100% infill) should work
Supports ON for Steth Ring - Normal

See Assembly Video for a 3D rendering of how to assemble the 3D printed parts and the diaphram
All connections require no glue and rely on a friction fit
In order to attach the Ring some pressure will be required this will then provide a tight fit

Microphone will then also provide a tight fit into the TPU connection piece
